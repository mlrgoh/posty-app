# Why I Like Coding

By Richard G

Coding lets me solve interesting problems and build things that help people. A few reasons I enjoy it:

- Problem solving: breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps is satisfying.
- Continuous learning: there are always new tools and techniques to learn.
- Creativity: writing code lets me design elegant solutions and craft user experiences.
- Feedback loop: running and iterating quickly shows tangible progress.

Thanks for reading — I hope this encourages you to try building something small today!
